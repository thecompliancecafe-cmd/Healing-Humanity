# 🌍 Healing Humanity
### Transparent, AI-Audited Charity Infrastructure on Blockchain

> Healing Humanity is a charity-native Web3 platform that transforms donations into **verifiable, auditable, and impact-backed proofs**.  
> Proudly built from **Nashik, India 🇮🇳**, for the world.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Traditional charity relies on trust.  
**Healing Humanity replaces blind trust with cryptographic proof.**

By combining **blockchain escrow**, **AI-based audits**, and **NFT Hypercerts**, we ensure that every donation:
- Is transparently tracked
- Is released only after verification
- Produces permanent proof of real-world impact

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔐 Smart Escrow Donations
- Donations are locked on-chain
- Funds release only after milestone approval
- Prevents misuse and leakage of funds

### 🤖 AI-Audited Impact
- AI reviews submitted impact evidence (images, reports, data)
- Produces an immutable audit result
- Audit hash anchored on-chain

### 🧾 Hypercerts (Proof-of-Impact NFTs)
- Each donation mints a Hypercert NFT
- Uses CEP-78 NFT standard
- Metadata links to IPFS-stored evidence

### 🎮 Gamified Participation
- XP, levels, and reputation
- Non-transferable (soulbound-style identity)
- Encourages long-term engagement
